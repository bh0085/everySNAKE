Welcome to everySNAKE, the crappy package of python computational 
biology tools upon which everyVECTOR will depend.

Actually, at this point there is going to be some redundancy between this
repo and the 'tal/utils' directory in the everyVECTOR directory installed 
with the webapp itself. 

In the future that will all be eliminated. As a general rule, 
everySNAKE will consist of:

1 - Wrappers around external utilities (such as MUSCLE or CLUSTAL)
2 - Convenience libraries for mapping external databases onto SQlite etc.
3 - Plotting libraries (including libraries that will be useful in exporting
  publication quality figurese from webapps as well.
4 - Generic analytics modules unsuitable upon which not only everyVECTOR
  but other tools that the EV team writes will lean.

While the everyVECTOR repo ('tal') is the proper place for:

1 - Python controllers and config necessary for webserver installation and
  non-analytic webapp usage.
2 - Javascript, HTML [MAKO] files necessary for the same.

Neither place is appropriate for:

1 - everyVECTOR plugins. They should live in other places and follow the
  plugin guidelines on the EV wiki.

Enjoy!
-The EveryVECTOR team.



**NOTES:

Peoplefuns contains little scripts that ben has created for other people,
some useful subset of which will at some point serve as templates for 
everyVECTOR plugins and the testing ground for everyVECTOR dataflows in
LDE.
